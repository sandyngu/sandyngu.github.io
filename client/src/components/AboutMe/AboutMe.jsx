In August 2020 to October 2020, I enrolled in the <span className="highlight bold">BrainStation Web Development</span> certificate course. I had an amazing time, learning about the webdev world and connecting with like-minded individuals who were seeking to transition their careers into tech. I have always had an interest in tech and this began for me at a very young age. <br/><br/><br/><b>During my time at the bootcamp, I was given the opportunity to work as a <span className="bold">Public Health Nurse</span></b> with my local city to aide in the <span className="red bold">COVID-19 pandemic</span> response. I took this job opportunity and although it's had its advantages, it also meant putting a pause on my full-stack career. This portfolio, along with other small projects, have been a way for me to help maintain some skills I've learned in the bootcampâ”€ hopefully I am successul in showcasing them.</p>
              <p className="aboutme__text aboutme__text2">Outside of work, I spend a lot of amount of time gaming on my PC. One of my accomplishments is building a PC to call my own. I'm an avid supporter of <span className="rainbow aboutme--bold">RGB</span>. 
              <br/><br/><br/>Presently, my go-to games are <a href="https://tracker.gg/valorant/profile/riot/Chawpsticks%23123/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span className="valorant">Valorant</span></a> and <span className="bold">Lost Ark</span>. <br/><br/>I have been playing Valorant since beta (currently Dia 2) and I play Lost Ark during down times (iLvl = 1435). Before that, I wasted a lot of time playing <a href="https://na.op.gg/summoners/na/Chawpsticks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><span className="league bold">League of Legends</span></a>. <br/><br/><i>Other than gaming</i>, I do enjoy spending time hanging out with loved ones and travelling.</p>
