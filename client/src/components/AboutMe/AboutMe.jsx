In August 2020 to October 2020, I enrolled in the <span className="highlight bold">BrainStation Web Development</span> certificate course. I had an amazing time, learning about the webdev world and connecting with like-minded individuals who were seeking to transition their careers into tech. I have always had an interest in tech and this began for me at a very young age. <br/><br/><br/><b>During my time at the bootcamp, I was given the opportunity to work as a <span className="bold">Public Health Nurse</span></b> with my local city to aide in the <span className="red bold">COVID-19 pandemic</span> response. I took this job opportunity and although it's had its advantages, it also meant putting a pause on my full-stack career. This portfolio, along with other small projects, have been a way for me to help maintain some skills I've learned in the bootcampâ”€ hopefully I am successul in showcasing them.</p>
